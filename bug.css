The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there are some uncommon errors that can occur when using `calc()`. One such error is using incompatible units within the `calc()` function. For instance, you can't directly add pixels and percentages, like `width: calc(50% + 100px);`. This will result in an error because the units are incompatible.  Another issue is forgetting the spaces around the operators in the `calc()` function.  `width:calc(50%+100px);` will likely produce an error. Spaces are mandatory around the +,-,*,/.
