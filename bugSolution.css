The solution is to ensure you are using compatible units within `calc()` and to always include spaces around the operators (+, -, 
*, /). For adding different units, consider using variables for a better approach and maintainability. 

Example:
```css
:root {
  --width-percentage: 50%;
  --width-pixels: 100px;
}

.element {
  width: calc(var(--width-percentage) + var(--width-pixels));
}
```
This approach is more maintainable and readable. The variables can easily be adjusted without needing to modify the `calc()` expression.  Always ensure correct spacing around the operator: `width: calc(50% + 100px);` is correct, `width:calc(50%+100px);` is incorrect.
