# CSS `calc()` Function Errors

This repository demonstrates two uncommon errors that can occur when using the CSS `calc()` function:

1. **Incompatible Units:**  Attempting to add or subtract units that aren't compatible (e.g., pixels and percentages) within a single `calc()` expression.
2. **Missing Spaces:** Forgetting to include spaces around the operators (+, -, *, /) within the `calc()` expression.

The `bug.css` file contains examples of these errors. The `bugSolution.css` file shows the corrected code.
